# Frontside Community Health Files

This contains our [default community health files](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file). These will be used if a matching file is not included in any of our repositories.

GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository owned by `thefrontside` that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the .github folder
- the docs folder

Default files are not included in clones, packages, or downloads of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.
