# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using a project? Here's how.

## How to get help

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides** for the project to see if you can figure it out on your own. See our documentation in the `readme.md` or on the documentation website. If there is an example project, explore that to learn how it works to see if you can answer your question.

1. :bulb: **Search for answers and ask questions in the discussions tab (if it is enabled).** This is the most appropriate place for debugging issues specific to your use of the project, or figuring out how to use the project in a specific way.

1. :bulb::bulb: **Search for answers and ask questions on [our discord](https://discord.gg/r6AvtnU).** We can help you with quick questions or thoughts. Also you are always welcome to join and enjoy the company of the community.
